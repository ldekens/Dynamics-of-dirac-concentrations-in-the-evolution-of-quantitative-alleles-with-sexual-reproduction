# Dynamics-of-dirac-concentrations-in-the-evolution-of-quantitative-alleles-with-sexual-reproduction

Codes to reproduce the figures of Dynamics of dirac concentrations in the evolution of quantitative alleles with sexual reproduction, L. Dekens and S. Mirrahimi, 2022

For figure 2:
- have fig2_dominant_alleles_trajectories.py and fig2_tools.py in the same folder
- run fig2_dominant_alleles_trajectories.py (it will call functions from fig2_tools.py during execution)
- be aware that this will run 3 processes in parallel (one for each selection function)

For figure 3:
- have fig3_phase_space.py and tools_fig3.py in the same folder
- run fig3_phase_space.py (it will call functions from fig2_tools.py during execution)
- be aware that this will run 3 processes in parallel (one for each selection function)
